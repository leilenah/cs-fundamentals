/**
 * A Fibonacci sequence is an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum
 * of the preceding two.
 *
 * The first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
 *
 * Write a function that returns the nth entry in the Fibonacci sequence,
 * where n is a number you pass in as argument to the function. E.g.
 *
 * fibonacci(3)  // --> 2
